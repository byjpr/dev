# dev

I like to move between an office desktop and a laptop for dev work whilst I move around my house. 
This allows me flexibility in finding the perfect spot to work from as my mood shifts. 

However, the drawback is managing the repos on multiple devices and keeping similar configs between them.

Instead I treat my computers like terminals, with a remote server that I SSH into. This is the setup pack for that server.

## Should I copy this?
Hell no. I'm an idiot. Feel free to take a look tho.
